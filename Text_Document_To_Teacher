I am sadly struggling with this project. I find it so hard to connect things. I kept retrying and redoing the project over and over but I feel everytime I do that. I feel like I am more lost.


So far from the videos from Tricks & Tips I have figured how to slowly get into it and what steps I have to finish. If my understanding is correct now, I just have left to know how to solve Create/Read/Update/Delete and implement that and later on in ConsoleApp try to re-use them?
After that, I will have to remember the steps on C# how what happens when you use case and what should happen in those situations. Then project is about finished?
I have tried to take help from other videos as well like respitory with databases but then I feel more confused and then it does not feel like I am doing way more unnecessary steps.
